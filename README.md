# Credit Risk Prediction Web App

A minimal **Streamlit** app that predicts **credit default probability** based on user inputs such as loan amount, income, interest rate, and more. The underlying model is an **XGBoost** (Gradient Boosting) classifier trained on a public credit risk dataset.

## **Project Overview**

Credit risk modeling is crucial for financial institutions to assess the likelihood that a borrower will default on a loan. This project demonstrates how to:

- Load and preprocess a **credit risk dataset**  
- Train a classification model (Logistic Regression, RandomForest, and **XGBoost**)  
- Deploy the final chosen model (XGBoost) into a **Streamlit** web application  
- Allow users to enter loan and income information for an **instant** default probability estimate  

## **Key Features**

1. **Interactive Input**: Users can input raw loan amount and annual income, which the app internally log-transforms (to match training data).  
2. **Immediate Prediction**: The app instantly calculates the likelihood of default based on the trained XGBoost model.  
3. **Clean UI**: Minimalist sliders, select boxes, and number inputsâ€”easy for anyone to use.  
4. **Extendable**: The code can easily be extended to use other models or more features.
